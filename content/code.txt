# /dev/null as a Service

Your developers will love our simple and well documented API. 
Just post your data in there we will take care about its deletion over
our Heavily Distributed BigData Cloud Cluster Setup!

    $ curl -d @invoice.pdf -X POST http://devnull-as-a-service.com/dev/null 
    
or if you are interested in some more informations about the ongoing deletion use

    $ curl -v -d @photos-of-yourself.zip -X POST http://devnull-as-a-service.com/dev/null 

If you're a `wget` Windows multiplatform lover you could use

    $ wget -O- -v --post-file=backups.tar.gz http://devnull-as-a-service.com/dev/null

# Self Hosted Enterprise Appliance!

For only $5000 per year you get our enterprise self hosted enterprise appliance.
Okay lets be honest, it's basicly a crappy Pentium4 Box with Debian and nginx installed. 

The configuration looks pretty much like

    location /dev/null {
        if ($request_method = POST ) {
          return 200;
        }
    }

But we think your data is worth it.
