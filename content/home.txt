In modern days everything is a service. You create
[documents](http://docs.google.com), upload [photos](http://instagram.com), 
deploy [computers](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), but what's happening
to your trash? That's why we're launching another of your favorite
applications to the cloud.

IAAS, SAAS, PAAS, holy fuckshit, we call our baby DAAS.

Dont get rid of your data yourself anymore. Use our distributed service 
located in over 380 countries! No matter if you're using it private or for your business.
Plans for whole companies available as well.

Just because of course and everything is should be a managed-service!

# Who we are

We're a young and dynamic team of data-scientics failed being employed
at the real market. Our Experience in losing data and throwing files
away is more than amazing! Over the years we managed to get rid of so many important data
at home and even at work. Pictures of our holidays, important invoices, login details... 
its all gone. So we started to make a business out of what we're good at.
