## Who we are

We're a young and dynamic team of data-scientics failed being employed
at the real market. Our Experience in losing data and throwing files
away is more than amazing! Over the years we managed to lose many files
at home or work. Pictures of our holidays, important invoices, login details... 
its all gone. So we started to make a business out of that.
